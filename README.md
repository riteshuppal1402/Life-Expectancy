# Life-Expectancy
## Statistical Analysis on factors influencing life expectancy in R.
Here I analyzed various factors such as immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors, and other health-related factors for 193 countries over 2000â€“2015. Since the observations in this dataset are based on different countries, it will be easier for a country to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to the lower value of life expectancy.
